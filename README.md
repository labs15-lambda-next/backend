## Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID - this is generated in the google console dev dashboard
    *  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET - this is generated in the google dashboard
