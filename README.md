## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`addUser(user object)` --> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

üö´ These are just examples, replace them with the specifics for your app

    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality not available in SQLite
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  JWT_SECRET - you can generate this by using a python shell and running import random''.join([random.SystemRandom().choice('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#\$%^&amp;*(-*=+)') for i in range(50)])
    *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
    *  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID - this is generated in the google console dev dashboard
    *  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET - this is generated in the google dashboard

#### sample .env file

---

```
PG_HOST=
PG_DB=
PG_USER=
PG_PASS=

STAGING=
S_HOST=
S_DB=
S_USER=
S_PASS=


GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
